This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within TRIFED to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.<\/p>\n<p>TRIFED Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on TRIFED or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of TRIFED; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of TRIFED, or the public.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use of Cookies<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The TRIFED Web site use \u201ccookies\u201d to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<\/p>\n<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize TRIFED pages, or register with TRIFED site or services, a cookie helps TRIFED to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

When you return to the same TRIFED Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the TRIFED features that you customized.<\/p>\n<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the TRIFED services or Web sites you visit.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security of your Personal Information<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>TRIFED secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. TRIFED secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
